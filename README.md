# libjpeg-turbo-bin

> [libjpeg-turbo](https://libjpeg-turbo.org/) is a JPEG image codec that uses SIMD instructions (MMX, SSE2, AVX2, NEON, AltiVec) to accelerate baseline JPEG compression and decompression on x86, x86-64, ARM, and PowerPC systems, as well as progressive JPEG compression on x86 and x86-64 systems. On such systems, libjpeg-turbo is generally 2-6x as fast as libjpeg, all else being equal.
